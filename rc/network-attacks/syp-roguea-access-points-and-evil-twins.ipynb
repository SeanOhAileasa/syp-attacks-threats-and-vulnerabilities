    "This might be an end user, an employee of the company who goes out and purchases a relatively inexpensive access point, brings it back into the office, and uses that to connect their own devices - this would obviously be a security concern, but not necessarily someone looking to cause any harm.\n",
    "\n",
    "But obviously, this could be a very significant security issue if someone was to gain access to that wireless access point and then ultimately access to your corporate network.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s becoming easier and easier to create a rogue access point on the network. It’s certainly easy to purchase an access point, bring it into the office, and plug it in wherever you happen to have an Ethernet network connection. \n",
    "\n",
    "Might also turn on wireless sharing inside of the operating system of your mobile device or your laptop or desktop - those devices can also look like an access point to other devices, and would effectively turn into a rogue access point inside of the computer that you’re already using.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why it’s always a good idea to perform periodic reviews of your wireless environment to make sure that the only access points you happen to see on your network are the ones that you put there - there are many third-party devices that can help you understand the wireless spectrum and who may be using the frequencies in your environment and there’s third-party tools, like the Wi-Fi Pineapple, that can set themselves up as a rogue access point to see if other people on the network happen to use it."
